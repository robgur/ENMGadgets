#' ModelThreshold - Thresholds Maxent suitability prediction based on user input. Output of the function is binary map of
#' predicted suitability as 1 and non suitabile region as 0. 
#' 
#' Function thresholds the suitability predicted by Maxent or by any other niche modeling algorithm, provided that 
#' predicted file is in .asc format. Function needs 4 parameters, input file, which is prediction file. Occurrence file, 
#' this a occurrence file used in calibrating the model. Format of this file is, speciesname, Longitude, Latitude.
#' PercentThreshold - what percent of ommission is agreable while calibrating the model. This percent is suppose to be decided
#' depending upon how the occurrences are sampled. 
#' OutSuitFile - Final thresholded prediction will be stored in this file and the format of this file is .asc. Suitability
#' will be reclassified into 0 and 1. All the pixels above the thresholded value will be classified as 1 and the pixels below
#' threshold value will be classified as 0.  
#' @import raster
#' @param InSuitFile - Maxent prediction in .asc format
#' @param OccurrenceFile - Occurrences using which Maxent model is trained.
#' @param PercentThreshold - Percent of ommission error, ranges between 0 - 1
#' @param OutSuitFile - Output file name. This file will be stored in the current working directory, if no path is given.
